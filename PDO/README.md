# Connecting to 4D Server from PHP via PDO

This repository is a collection of PHP scripts (code snippets) to help get connected to 4D Server from PHP.
It may be broken, it may not work, it may not help (hopefully it helps though).

### Requirements

On the 4D side you need:
* 4D Server
 * 4D's SQL Server must be started and accessible to the client (default port 19812)

On the PHP client side you need:
* PHP
* PDO_4D module


Note that SQL/ODBC connections to 4D Server will consume a 4D Client license in the absence of an Unlimited SQL license.
